## üöÄ Project Overview

You know that stage when you're learning a new language‚Äîwhen you've mastered the basics and it's time to consume real content to improve your understanding and proficiency? Whether it's watching movies, listening to podcasts, or reading in your target language, immersion is key.

**Audiolingu** is an AI-powered podcast generator tailored for language learning. You specify your target language, current level, and interests, and it generates custom podcast episodes designed just for you. Each episode includes interactive transcripts, AI-generated quizzes to test comprehension, multiple voice options, and progress tracking to help you level up‚Äîall built for The Modern Stack Hackathon.

This repository is fully open source. You can explore, modify, or contribute to the code.
